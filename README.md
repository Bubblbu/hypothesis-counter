# Hypothesis Counter

> Preview the number of annotations on the current page in Firefox

## Status Quo

I created this extension as Hypothesis does not offer an official Firefox extension yet. Thus, my first priority was to get it running on Firefox. In theory, thanks to the WebExtension API, the Hypothesis Counter should also be working with Chrome, Opera, and Edge.

**Supported Browsers**

- [x] Firefox (tested on 60.x)
- [ ] Chrome
- [ ] Edge

## Installation

Currently only available as an unpacked extension.

**Installation for devs**

1. `git clone git@github.com:Bubblbu/hypothesis-counter.git`
2. Open "about:debugging" in Firefox, click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select any file in your extension's directory
3. The extension will now be installed, and will stay until you restart Firefox.
